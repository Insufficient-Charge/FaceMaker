# FaceMaker
This project will draw a face using shapes via a point-to-point brush-drawing implementation with JavaFX using a provided library.

When first run, the program will generate a GUI that allows for user input to specify what shapes the user would like to make the face up of. For example, the
user can specify if they want the face to have triangles for eyes, a circle for the mouth, and/or a square for the head-shape.
